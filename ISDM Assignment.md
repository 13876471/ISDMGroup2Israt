### Agile Methodology (Bilal)

Agile methodology is the process in which a team manages a project by breaking it up into smaller more manageable parts and constantly collaborates with stakeholders of the project. The project improves in every iteration. Scrum is the method that has been utilised in this project. Scrum is the most popular agile methodology used [] and assumes that plans need to be changed regularly. Therefore, scrum was the agile methodology chosen for this project. Methods used in this project were daily scrum meetings via messenger chat and calls, everyone would speak about wat they completed, will complete and what is hindering their progress. Furthermore, sprint planning and retrospectives was implemented in the project. At the start of each week the team would be designated goals and on Thursday the team would have a meeting with the stakeholders, to assess the changes in the project and present new ideas.
