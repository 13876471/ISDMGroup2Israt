Executive Summary 


Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to develop an information system which will help to improve the efficiency of the operation of the in-house call management centre of the travel company using agile or scrum technology. The purpose of the information system is to provide assistance and match the Relationship Managers with their end customers on the basis of their skills and customer profiles. The system should be able to adjust call flow rate to suitable RMs so they can perform good sales on holiday packages. The aim of the system to provide assistance to RMs is to make sure that the call flow control and call routing for both inbound and outbound calls are improved and dynamic respectively. 
The system should be able to create profiles for customers and RMs. The strategy is to match the 2 entities on the basis of the profile. Creating profile can include basic information like age, sex, culture, laguange proficiency. It could also include social and cultural segments depending on the postcodes and lastname. 
The approach to create the information system includes numerous system development methodologies that we have practised in our subject. Some of the approaches are like using agile methodologies, design thinking.

Design Thinking 

The combination of critical and creative ideas can help improve information systems in dynamic ways. It can find the roots of the problem occurring in the system  as well as help to develop new ideas. The approach always encapsulates customers and is based on their needs which will lead in the development of a customer based IS. 
The five stages of design thinking process is as follows;

Empathize
Define
Ideate
Prototype
Test

Empathise 

The first stage of the design thinking process starts by understanding the needs of the customers. All the requirements should also be enlisted. The goal to understand the relationship between RM and customers is very vital in this stage. Empathy map is drawn below to draw the requirements of the stakeholders of the travel company.

Define the problem 

The second stage of the design thinking process is by evaluating the problems encountered while understanding the requirements of the customers. There will also be cases where the customer may change their requirements time and again.
After studying through the requirements we can come to a conclusion that  it is vital that we eliminate customers hanging up the calls at busy times.This will not only keep end customers happy but will help to increase sales. The long wait time is a major factor to be considered that leads to customer hanging up calls. The IS should be able to reduce the wait time so the customers do not have to face any delay. 

The deployment to minimise this delay will allow the customer to
